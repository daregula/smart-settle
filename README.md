This guest account has a list of queries located in the "My Searches" section which can be found on the drop-down menu when hovering over "Get Started" in the navbar. We ran these searches on our localhost host which displays the results given the specific criteria shown on each card in "My Searches". You can view the resulting cities after pressing the green button "View Result" on each card. When a user submits a fresh query, they get navigated to the result page showcasing the same page when the "View Result" button is pressed. Due to limitations with API usage on the deployment side, <ins>**we have temporarily disabled the ability to create new queries**</ins> but feel free to run through the survey that can be found in the center of the homepage when you click "Get Started".
